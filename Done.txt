; Done items

Added: Given I am using C64 processor port options
	This stops writes to the IO registers from going to RAM



* Add emulated BombJack display
	https://github.com/martinpiper/BombJack/blob/master/README.md
	Sprites notes
		0x = far left visible screen pixel
		Done 0y = 16x16 Top of the sprite just below the bottom edge of the visible screen
		Done 0y = 32x32 Middle horizontal part of the sprite just below the bottom edge of the visible screen
	Add 32x32 sprites 9a00-9a01 (largeSprite)
		Done - Check the hardware for how the inclusive register really works with regards to using sprite update slots
			0-3	 No 32x32
			0-4	 Sprite 0 is 32x32, sprite 1 is not drawn, sprites 2 onwards are drawn
			0-5	 Sprite 0,2 is 32x32, sprite 1,3 is not drawn, sprites 4 onwards are drawn
			0-6	 Sprite 0,2,4 is 32x32, sprite 1,3,5 is not drawn, sprites 6 onwards are drawn
			0-7	 Sprite 0,2,4,6 is 32x32, sprite 1,3,5,7 is not drawn, sprites 8 onwards are drawn

			1-4	 Sprite 0 is 32x32, sprite 1 is not drawn, sprites 2 onwards are drawn
			2-4	 Same
			3-4	 Same
			4-4	 No 32x32
			4-5	 Sprites 0-1 are normal, Sprite 2 is 32x32, Sprite 3 is not drawn, sprites 4 onwards are drawn

			5-4	 Sprites 0-1 are normal, Sprite 2 is 32x32, Sprite 3 is not drawn, sprites 4 onwards are drawn
			5-5	 No 32x32
			6-5	 Sprites 0-3 are normal, Sprite 4 is 32x32, Sprite 5 is not drawn, sprites 6 onwards are drawn
			7-5	 Sprites 0-3 are normal, Sprite 4,6 is 32x32, Sprite 5,7 is not drawn, sprites 8 onwards are drawn

			1-5	 Sprite 0,2 is 32x32, sprite 1,3 is not drawn, sprites 4 onwards are drawn
			2-5	 Same


			Does it skip the next sprite?
				Yes
			What about the odd numbers sprites for the ranges?
				No, not the lines into 5R 5S
		Also the sprite frame, does it multiply the sprite frame to ensure it is aligned?
			Yes, it multiplies by 4
			What is the sprite layout?
				01
				23
	Do sprites off the far right appear on the left?
		Yes
	Do sprites off the bottom appear on the top?
		No.
	Done - Add full height mode (fullHeightSprite)



* Emulated hardware display
	When allocating layers, make the address and addressEx configurable
	TODO: Address configs for addressEx=0x01 need to respect the INRAMSEL1 groups 0x8000 0x8800 0x9000 0x9800 ... 0xb800 as these used for selection on each board
		Video board uses fixed address, not configurable.
