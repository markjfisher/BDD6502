* Add emulated BombJack display
    https://github.com/martinpiper/BombJack/blob/master/README.md
    Add 32x32 sprites 9a00-9a01 (largeSprite)
    Add full height mode (fullHeightSprite)



* I need some syntax that measures the percentage of code executed and memory accessed so I can have code coverage metrics during tests
  and fails if a test doesn't exercise what I think are important code paths



* Add cartridge support
	Read CRT files and store their banks and addresses into a map for easy lookup
	Add syntax to optionally configure cartridge bank address, whether it is read enabled
	Add syntax to specify combinatorial logic (use the variable resolution code ) on multiple locations and enable/disable carts banks, kernal/BASIC ROMs etc
		This can also support bank sizes by mapping cart banks with addresses
	Obviously more than one rule and multiple ROM binary or CRT files can be specified allowing complex cart bank/ROM arrangements to be created
	
	
	
* Add support for simulating IRQs and NMIs called via customised entry points and timings.
	For example FFFE or 0314 entry point can be specified directly



* Branch instructions followed by a $xx value must take into account the current PC and calculate the correct destination address before encriching the disassembly output



* Branch instructions must take into account the current ST and indicate of they will be taken, perhaps by highlighting the destination address



* Try to convert the PC to the nearest function label+XXX value by reading the debugger PDB output
