BDD6502
=======

A project to allow Behaviour Driven Development to be used with 6502 code.

The idea is to allow 6502 code to be tested with human readable automated tests. The tests will contain expected software behaviour.
This uses a 6502 simulator in the JVM to allow very low level control over the virtual machine test environment.
